# To-Do List Manager

This console-based program allows a user to add and remove tasks to a tasks list. Each of these tasks has a name and date by which the task should be completed. Either of these task details may be modified for any
task in the list. To run the program, clone this repository and make sure that you have Go (found [here](https://go.dev/dl/)) installed on your machine. Once Go is
installed, run *go run .* in the parent directory to start the program.
